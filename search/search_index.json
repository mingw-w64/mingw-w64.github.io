It has forked it in 2007 in order to provide support for 64 bits and new APIs. It has since then gained widespread use and distribution. The development and community are very active and welcoming with new contributors every month and simple installers. Headers, Libraries and Runtime More than a million lines of headers are provided, not counting generated ones, and regularly expanded to track new Windows APIs. Everything needed for linking and running your code on Windows. Winpthreads, a pthreads library for C++11 threading support and simple integration with existing project. Winstorecompat, a work-in-progress convenience library that eases conformance with the Windows Store. Better-conforming and faster math support compared to VisualStudio's. Tools gendef: generate Visual Studio .def files from .dll files. genidl: generate .idl files from .dll files. widl: compile .idl files.

There are references to other websites on this page; their presence does not constitute an endorsement in any way. Win32 API and Runtime Mingw-w64 is constantly looking for updates to its win32 API headers from MSDN Library .

From past experiences however, if you do use an email client to attach individual patches, please use the .txt extension, especially for Google Mail users so the patch does not get treated as a binary. SEH for 32bits The patent for SEH for 32bits has now expired and while new computers are all 64 bits, Intel has continued selling Atom CPUs that only handled 32 bits very late and some applications are still 32 bits. Projects such as Wine and ReactOS will also benefit from 32bits SEH. Overall the need is still there and will continue for years to come and will outlast Microsoft's support for 32bits. Note that you will need FSF paperwork since the work has to be done inside GCC. Check CC's page on contributing. The now-expired patent on SEH A Crash Course on the Depths of Win32\u2122 Structured Exception Handling Win32 Exceptions \u2013 OS Level Point of View How a C++ compiler implements exception handling Structured Exception Handling Basics Windows' SEH and C++ Exception Handling Structured Exception Handling Considered Harmful SEH and C++ Exceptions - catch all in one GCC sources and unwind-seh.c in particular. Note that 32-bit SEH is stack-based and requires code-generation unlike 64bits SEH which is simply table-based (that difference explains why the patent only mattered to 32bits). Sanitizers (ASAN, TSAN, USAN) Sanitizers are runtime checks for a number of situations which have usually required instrumentation with tools that cause an important slowdown (like Valgrind). They are relatively new and much lighter than other approaches. Thorough Status Report for Sanitizers (asan, tsan, usan) ASAN, TSAN and USAN are great technologies which are available in GCC. Unfortunately they are not completely usable on Windows. A proper review and tests are needed before anything. Fixing remaining bits in asan, tsan or usan (see above) Once a report on the status is available, work on it can be started. Link-Time Optimization (LTO) Optimizations in C cannot cross compilation units and many of them are therefore missed in large applications and when using libraries. LTO runs some optimizations during linking, when the toolchain can see all the objects at once and run cross-unit optimizations. Thorough Status Report for LTO LTO has recently been improved a lot in GCC and binutils. There are still some issues on Windows though. The first step to making it work is to get a proper and up-to-date test and to identify the platform-specific bugs. Fixing remaining bits in LTO Fix the issues found by the status report from above. The actual bug list will be updated as it becomes available. Compiler plugin for Visual Studio A compiler plugin would make GCC, binutils tools and GDB available from the Visual Studio IDE. Most people state they stick with VS because of the IDE; such a plugin would allow mixing the two. VisualGDB (commercial) provides such a plugin, apparently meant for compiling to micro-controllers and Linux (Android or not). Debug Infos PDB is the file-format used by Microsoft to store debug info. Unfortunately it is undocumented. Documentation of the PDB file-format Since the format is undocumented, first step is to document it. Fortunately, during the past few years, reader and possibly writer code has appeared, mostly out of Microsoft. A library named ''dump_syms'' is available. It can read PDB files at least to some extent. Licensing and origin need to be checked. Microsoft has released Roslyn, a \".NET Compiler Platform\" . It contains a PDB writer implementation . This may be an actual implementation or only an interface to the actual one. It is difficult to say without further analysis. Microsoft has also released CCI Metadata under the MS-PL . It contains PDB reader implementation that should constitute an appropriate source. Creation of PDB files Creating PDB files will allow the Microsoft tools to make meaningful backtraces when code built with free compilers is involved. Handling of PDB in GDB Reading PDB files will allow free tools to make meaningful backtraces when code built with MSVC is involved. Translation from/to PDB Most often debug informations will only be available in a single format. Being able to convert between them when needed will be useful. C11 and C++11 Threading Support C11 Threading and Atomics The C11 standard has a section on threading which is still left unimplemented on several platforms. The API follows pthreads' quite closely and it is left to the implementor to decide whether to base it on winpthreads or directly on the (>= Vista) Win32 API. The final C11 draft is identical to the standard but is available freely. Note that you will need FSF paperwork since the work has to be done inside GCC. Check GCC's page on contributing . Implementation of C11 and C++11 Threading Support Without Winpthreads mcfgthread The mcfgthread library aims at providing an efficient implementation of thread support for GCC that is required by the C11 and C++11 standard. It uses a lot of undocumented Windows NT syscalls to ensure performance.

In particular, if mingw-w64 saves you from the steep cost of proprietary toolchains, think about contributing a bit; you will also most likely quickly benefit from the improvements.
